#  Craig Will Fix It

'Craig Will Fix It' is a bookmarklet to replace images of Jimmy Savile with the NSPCC hotline number. This is a very simple bookmarklet and is a work in progress, but if anyone wants to contribute than please do!

## Updates

The bookmarklet has been updated and now dynamically resizes the advert to fit the size of the existing image. This means that the advert can been seen more clearly at larger and smaller sizes.

## Further Development

* At the moment it finds image with 'savile' in the src or alt text. This could be refined to be more accurate and also extended to also take into consideration other terms E.g. Jim'll Fix It, etc...
